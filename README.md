everything related to coursework, read it once before creating your coursework and come back if you need more information.

# Code

- It is highly recommended to use a github repository for your coursework. This will allow you to
keep track of all your changes, and prevents losing any code. It also can be useful when creating a
developer diary in your writeup. Learn more about creating repositories [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories),
and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is a nice gui tool to use.

> [!NOTE]
> Make your repository _before_ your winforms solution, then set the directory for your solution to the repository folder.

- When creating your solution, make sure _NOT_ to select the `Framework` option. Framework is old and
sucks and these resources may not all work in conjunction with it.

- Using an existing UI library such as [Material Skin 2](https://github.com/DigitalAdeel/MaterialSkin2DotNet) can
save a lot of time, and make your application look nice by default.

- Write smart code. Making your code more generic ( fit more use cases ) will greatly improve your experience when adding
features in the future.

- Use MVC from the beginning! Its a lot harder to sort everything into MVC after its all written.

- Keep it simple, having a intuitive frontend is almost as important as having a working backend

# Writeup

- Do __NOT__ leave the writeup to the last minute, it is not worth it. Create the structure of the writeup at the beginning,
and then gradually work on it throughout the year.

- Sample coursework can be found in the "SAMPLE_COURSEWORK" folder on the google drive. Use them!
